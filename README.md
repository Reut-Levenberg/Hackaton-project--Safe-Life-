## About The Project
"Safe Life" identifies when an elderly person is in distress and calls for help.
The system detects person fall, by a "pose detection" algorithm for identifying the movment of the human body.
If the system detects a fall, it makes a phone contact with a predefine person: relative, staff member, etc.<br>
For the phone contact,  we used the "twilio" library.

## built-with
Build in Python, use OpenCV open source, including machine learning.

## Installation
"pose detection" algorithm from OpenCV.<br>
"twilio" library.

## How to use?
To use the system, you need to install a camera in the desired location,
